## Conclusion
•	Crime started rising around 1960 in New York City for unknown reasons. Crime started decreasing in 1991, due to a new mayor and his 'get tough’ policing policies.

•	California, there was a lot of competition for the crack market from the late 1980s to the 1990s in the inner city community, and that led to a large number of homicides and other vices.
